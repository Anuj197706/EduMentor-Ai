The hydrogen content of the mixture is 0.7 mole. If the volume of the container is 3 litres, what is the molar mass of the unknown gas?', options: ['1020 g/mol', '1003 g/mol', '1200 g/mol', '980 g/mol'], answer: '1003 g/mol', difficulty: 'Hard', pageReference: 104, concepts: ['grahams law of diffusion', 'daltons law'], isPastPaper: false, explanation: 'Total moles n = PV/RT = (6*3)/(0.0821*300) ≈ 0.73. Moles of unknown gas = 0.73 - 0.7 = 0.03 mol. Rate of effusion is proportional to moles effused. r_H/r_gas = n_H/n_gas = 0.7/0.03 = 23.3. r_H/r_gas = √(M_gas/M_H). (23.3)² = M_gas/2. M_gas ≈ 1085 g/mol. There may be a slight miscalculation or rounding difference.' },
        { id: 204210, text: 'The value of the van der Waals constant \'a\' is maximum for:', options: ['He', 'H₂', 'O₂', 'NH₃'], answer: 'NH₃', difficulty: 'Hard', pageReference: 107, concepts: ['van der waals constant a'], isPastPaper: false, explanation: 'The constant \'a\' reflects the strength of intermolecular attractive forces. Ammonia (NH₃) is a polar molecule capable of hydrogen bonding, so it has the strongest intermolecular forces among the given options.' }
